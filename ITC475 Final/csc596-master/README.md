There is an issue with Github pages deployment at the moment not loading the svg file though sometimes it will load but will take around <=10 mins or even more.  Recommend to download entire repo and run for now.

For an example here is a github pages deployment, however, if svg does not load then there is no terrain (svg not loading) and cannot move or transform robot which are all things you can do in the actual game.  So please only use for reference to what this game would look like if svg does not load.  If svg does load this sample game is as what is found in the current repo.  To move forward (right arrow), to move backward (left arrow), to transform wheel legs out (up arrow), to retract wheel legs back (down arrow), to increase wheel size (s), to decrease wheel size (a)
